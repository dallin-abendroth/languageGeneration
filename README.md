# languageGeneration

This is a small project intended to: 

  * Generate names of people, places, and things that feel real and share an aesthetic as though they were taken from an imaginary language.
  * Get my feet wet in Haskell. 

Martin O'Leary has implemented a version of this in JavaScript [here](https://github.com/mewo2/naming-language) as part of his amazing Uncharted Atlas ([@unchartedatlas](https://twitter.com/unchartedatlas)) twitter bot. 

My implementation will heavily draw from [Martin's notes](https://mewo2.com/notes/naming-language/) on generating naming languages. He very clearly explains his thinking at each step, the limitations of several potential approaches, and the clever methods he comes up with to deliver on his vision for the tool. Very fun read and a very cool case study of examining and understanding the domain you're working with.
